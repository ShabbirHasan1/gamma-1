Well I don't know what I wanna build with this.

I wasn't really consistent in developing this project completely and that made me leave some files incomplete and also I added many modules, which I have to read again to make sense of it.

Anyhow I devided to make it public, if someone is motivated or stupid enough to go through the whole code, you're welcome to do so.

### Overview

Just an overview though, there is a lot going on in this project, from scraping, simulating, APIs just to gather informations. And there is still a lot I am planning to do, but it is getting out of hand and I can't really make sense of any of it. So I decided to use this code but this time with much more planning and proper documentations.

So this will just be garbage code.
