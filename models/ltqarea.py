Ok, so currently it is just an idea and I wanna visualize and look at the results.

So first I need to be find a way to find area under any curve, since it will be random so I need to assume graph can be 
anything and I need to find a general way to find equations for all of them, which later can be used in integration to 
find the area under that graph.

In theory this should be directly proportional to the capital inclusion and the variance of the graph. And I am hoping 
it will provide more insights into the microstructure of the asset.
